# GnoBlog CLI

WIP, See [#1](https://github.com/gnolang/blog/issues/1)

A standalone client to manage blogposts on [`r/gnoland/blog`](https://github.com/gnolang/gno/tree/master/examples/gno.land/r/gnoland/blog) powered by [`p/demo/blog`](https://github.com/gnolang/gno/tree/master/examples/gno.land/p/demo/blog).

It parses blogposts located in [`../blog`](../blog) and publish them.

(Current) live version: https://test3.gno.land/r/gnoland/blog
